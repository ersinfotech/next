=========================

An opinionated setup I plan to use for my libraries.

It has CommonJS and UMD builds via Babel and Webpack, ESLint, and Ava.  

Note that this is an *opinionated* boilerplate. You might want to:

* Remove `stage-0` preset in `.babelrc` so you donâ€™t depend on language features that might be gone tomorrow;

You have been warned.
